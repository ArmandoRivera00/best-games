          Grand Theft Auto IV is a 2008 game developed and published by Rockstar Games. 
        </p>
        <p1>
        This game was initially available for the Xbox 360 and PS3.
        The reason why GTA IV made it on my personal list is because I played it and really enjoyed how the story of it developed and the overall gameplay compared
        to other games on the Grand Theft Auto Saga.

          <p4>
            I got introduced to this game not too long ago, when  I bought it during the Easter steam sale on the Valve Complete Pack.
            Afterwards I asked friends what I should stream, and a lot of them suggested me Portal! Which I ended up enjoying and
            ended up appreciating this game entirely.

          <p6>
            I got into this game back in 2019 and started playing on the Nintendo Switch where after a while I got a lot into it and honestly, with a lot of updates
            I've grown to love this simple yet complex game as I play with friends or by myself.

          <p7>
            Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a 2020 game released originally for the Play Station 5 and recently released on PC.
          </p7>
          <p8> This game made it on my list due to the amazing story expanding from the first game, and going straight to the point.
            Even though this game was way shorter than the original one "Marvel's Spider-Man" I found this being a more compelling 
            and polished game. </p8>

          <p9>Descenders is a 2018 videogame released for the PC with subsequent releases on Xbox, Android, and Nintendo Switch which is about free bikeriding.</p9>
          <p10>Honestly, I found this game around 2021, and tried it for the first time and I fell in love with it. It was a breath of fresh air for me as I had never experimented
            this type of game and it just stuck with me and I loved it. </p10>
